# Budgething 2023 (WIP)
App for aggregating transactional data from bank account(s) and analyzing income and spendings. The development of the app is put on hold as of 07/10/2023. My focus currently shifted towards a web-based version of it. The app can be run (provided the project is set up correctly) from `budgeting-app\budgeting_app\gui\app.py`. The drag 'n' drop window only accepts PDF files. Within the image editor a.k.a. table extractor tables can be drawn, the number of columns/rows can be altered but modifying dimensions of column/row/table requires further work. The settings (as provided by pdfplumber library) can be altered and changes applied to the image of the pdf. Data from a single table (either generated by pdfplumber or manually created) are extracted and displayed correctly as well as data from multiple table are aggregated as they should. Table cannot be removed nor its position cannot be altered. Rough TO-DO list: services for handling CSV/JSON files, dashboard, datacentre, user backend and probably much more.
